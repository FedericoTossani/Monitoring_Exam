# Monitoring_Exam

I wrote this code for the "Monitoring Ecosystem Changes and Functioning" course @Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna

The purpose of this code is to analize wetland ecosystems across Europe and relate it to changes in birds populations use.

DATA

The data used in this analysis came from Landsat satellite.

To study birds populations changes I downloaded the data from European Environmental Agency databases.

Area of interest

For this project I will use images of italian wetlands located in Northwestern Adriatic Coast.
