# Monitoring_Exam

I wrote this code for the "Monitoring Ecosystem Changes and Functioning" course @Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna

The purpose of this code is to analize wetland ecosystems across Europe and relate it to changes in birds populations use.

## Data

The data used in this analysis came from Landsat satellite.

To study birds populations changes I downloaded the data from European Environmental Agency databases.

## Area of interest

For this project I will use images of italian wetlands located in Northwestern Adriatic Coast.

## The process

1. Download the images from Earth Explorer

    I need one image per wetland every 10 years, starting from the '80s.
    Ideally it will be 2021 - 2011 - 2001 - 1991 - 1984.
    As the wetlands are close togheter i just need 2 Landsat raw images, the one with path and row and 

2. Image pre-processing

    From the raw downloaded files I will create a raster stack object for every wetland per year.

3. Analysis
